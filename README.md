```

## Restock System

The plugin features an automatic restock system:

- **Default Interval**: 24 hours
- **Customizable**: Individually adjustable per shop
- **Automatic**: Trades are checked and restocked when opening the shop
- **Persistent**: Restock times are saved and survive server restarts

### How it works:
1. When a trade reaches its maximum uses, it's marked as "sold out"
2. After the configured restock time expires, the trade becomes available again
3. The check occurs every time a player opens the shop

## Configuration

Shops are automatically saved in `plugins/ShopPlugin/shops/` as YAML files. Each shop has its own file with the following format:

```yaml
display-name: "¬ß6My Shop"
restock-hours: 24
trades:
  - input-material: DIAMOND
    input-amount: 1
    output-material: DIAMOND_SWORD
    output-amount: 1
    max-uses: 10
    output-display-name: "&cFire Sword"
    output-enchantments: "FIRE_ASPECT:2,SHARPNESS:5"
restock-times:
  0: 1640995200000
```

## Troubleshooting

### Shop won't open
- Check the permission `shopplugin.use.<shopname>` or `shopplugin.use.*`
- Make sure the shop exists with `/shop list`

### Trades don't work
- Check material names (must be exact)
- Use `/shop trades <shopname>` to see all trades

### Potions have no effects
- Make sure you use `POTION`, `SPLASH_POTION` or `LINGERING_POTION` as material
- Check the potion type with `/shop potions`

## Support

For problems or questions:
1. Check server logs for error messages
2. Make sure all permissions are set correctly
3. Use `/shop info` to get plugin information
